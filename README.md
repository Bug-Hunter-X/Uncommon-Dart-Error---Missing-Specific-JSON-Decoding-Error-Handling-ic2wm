# Uncommon Dart Error: Missing Specific JSON Decoding Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle error in Dart code that involves network requests and JSON parsing. The original code lacks specific handling for JSON decoding failures, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior. The solution provides improvements for more robust error handling.

## Bug Description
The `fetchData` function fetches data from a remote API. While it handles HTTP status codes and general exceptions, it doesn't specifically handle `FormatException` that can arise from `jsonDecode` if the response isn't valid JSON.  This can lead to cryptic error messages that are difficult to debug.

## Solution
The solution enhances the error handling by catching `FormatException` specifically. This allows for more precise error handling and reporting, making it easier to identify and address the root cause of JSON decoding issues.
